# FastAPI Practice Backend 

This project is a personal educational backend built with **FastAPI**, **SQLAlchemy (async)**, **Alembic**, and **PostgreSQL**.  
It is being developed to improve backend development skills, database handling, and API structuring.

Although there is no specific business goal yet, the project simulates a real-world backend architecture and serves as a base for more advanced features in the future.

---

## Tech Stack (Current)

- **FastAPI** — lightweight Python web framework for APIs
- **SQLAlchemy (Async ORM)** — database layer
- **PostgreSQL** — relational database
- **Alembic** — migrations management
- **Pydantic** — data validation
- **Uvicorn** — ASGI server

---

## Planned Tech Stack (Future)

- **JWT Authentication**
- **OAuth2 / Google login**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Pytest** for API and DB testing
- **Redis** (caching/session store)
- **Rate limiting**
- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions)**

---

## Purpose

This project is built mainly for **learning and portfolio** purposes.  
It's a place to experiment, practice clean architecture, and build up backend intuition with async Python technologies.

## How to Run Locally

> Make sure you have Python 3.10+ and PostgreSQL installed.

1. **Clone the repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fastapi-practice-backend.git
cd fastapi-practice-backend
```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Create `.env` file**

Make a `.env` file in the root directory with your database settings:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=fastapi_db
```

5. **Run migrations**
```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

6. **Start the server**
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to access Swagger UI
